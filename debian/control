Description: Yubico two-factor password+OTP (YubiKey) PAM module
 This is the Yubico PAM module. It enables you to set up your system to
 require two-factor authentication with your normal username and password
 and a YubiKey OTP that is validated against an online validation service.
 .
 The default validation service is the free YubiCloud, but you can easily
 set up and use your own validation service.
 .
 A second mode of operation is available using the YubiKeys HMAC-SHA-1
 Challenge-Response functionality. Using this mode, you can accomplish
 offline validation using a YubiKey, for example on a laptop computer.
 This only works for local logins though, and not for logging in using
 for example SSH.
